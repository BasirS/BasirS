# Hi, I'm Basir! üëã

**Data Science Analyst @ Care.com** | **AI Fellow @ Cornell Tech** | **IAC Fellow**  
üéì Statistics & Quantitative Modeling Student | üìç New York, NY

I'm a third-year Statistics and Quantitative Modeling student with dual minors in Biology and Chemistry. Currently serving as a Data Science Analyst at Care.com and AI Fellow at Cornell Tech through the Break Through Tech program. I'm passionate about combining data analytics with healthcare, leveraging statistical modeling and machine learning to solve real-world problems.

## üéØ Featured Project: Healthcare Analytics - Early Warning System for Hospital Monitoring

**Comprehensive statistical analysis** of 139 months of hospital data (1999-2011) to develop an early warning system for detecting anomalous patterns in patient care metrics. Successfully identified the **Ben Geen incident period** using multiple anomaly detection methods.

- **Tech Stack:** R, Time Series Analysis (ETS Models), CUSUM Analysis, Statistical Modeling
- **Scope:** 4-phase analysis pipeline including EDA, time series modeling, anomaly detection, and early warning system development
- **Performance:** Achieved 100% sensitivity for emergency admissions and 91% specificity for respiratory events
- **Methods:** Z-score analysis, Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts, residual analysis, count time series models
- **Impact:** Validated system against known incident periods, demonstrating potential for real-world healthcare monitoring
