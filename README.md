# Hi, I'm Basir! üëã

**Statistics & Quantitative Modeling Student** | **Break Through Tech AI Fellow**  
üéì Zicklin School of Business | üìç New York, NY

I'm passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights, with a focus on healthcare analytics and bioinformatics. As a Break Through Tech Fellow, I've developed expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to solve real-world problems in critical sectors.

## üéØ Featured Project: Healthcare Analytics - Early Warning System for Hospital Monitoring

**Comprehensive statistical analysis** of 139 months of hospital data (1999-2011) to develop an early warning system for detecting anomalous patterns in patient care metrics. Successfully identified the **Ben Geen incident period** using multiple anomaly detection methods.

- **Tech Stack:** R, Time Series Analysis (ETS Models), CUSUM Analysis, Statistical Modeling
- **Scope:** 4-phase analysis pipeline including EDA, time series modeling, anomaly detection, and early warning system development
- **Performance:** Achieved 100% sensitivity for emergency admissions and 91% specificity for respiratory events
- **Methods:** Z-score analysis, Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts, residual analysis, count time series models
- **Impact:** Validated system against known incident periods, demonstrating potential for real-world healthcare monitoring
